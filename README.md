Crowdfunding idea

I think a good crowdfunding idea would be the creation of a face mask for sleeping. The deliverables would be the creation of the sleeping mask. The face mask would keep your head warm while you sleep but allow you to breathe cold air comfortably. Instead of putting the blankets above the head and heating up really fast. This would be ideal for people who are sick and need to be bed, but also for anyone who would like to keep their heads warm while breathing in cold air. Preferablly used durinhg cold times and in cold clomates.

Three rewards would be 1. The first to recieve it and try it. 2. Help name it. 3. Choose the look of it.
